# Errors

#### Errors are a fact in life of a Software. They are inevitable and must be handled gracefully. But Rust handles it pretty uniquely. 

### It majorly considers errors in 2 types:

1. **Recoverable Errors**: These are errors that can be recovered from, such as file not found errors. Rust provides the `Result` enum to handle these errors.
2. **Unrecoverable Errors**: These are errors that cannot be recovered from, such as out-of-memory errors. Rust provides the `panic!` macro to handle these errors.

### Most other programming languages handle both types of errors similarly using **Exception Handling** mechanisms. But Rust does it differently. Rust doesn't have exceptions. Instead, it uses `Result<T, E>` to handle recoverable errors and `panic!` macro to handle unrecoverable errors.

### Here we are gonna talk about `panic!` first and later about `Result<T, E>`
