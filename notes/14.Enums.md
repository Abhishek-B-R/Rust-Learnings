# Enums

### enums give you a way of saying a value is one of a possible set of values. It is either of given values but not all. For ex, here it's either V4 or V6, not both.

```rust
enum IPAddrKind {
    V4(u8,u8,u8,u8),
    V6(String),
}

fn main() {
    let home = IPAddrKind::V4(127,0,0,1);
    let loopback = IPAddrKind::V6(String::from("::1"));
}
```
### In order to add functionalities like printing the IP address, we can add a method to the enum. We have to use **impl** syntax and define methods under that. Ex:
```rust
impl IPAddr{
    fn display(&self){
        match self{
            IPAddr::V4(a,b,c,d) => println!("{}.{}.{}.{}",a,b,c,d),
            IPAddr::V6(addr) => println!("{}",addr),
        }
    }
}
```


## Some standard library enums
### IpAddr from std::net::IpAddr
Used to stored ip4 and ip6 addresses neatly.

### Option:

# Rust doesn't have a concept of **Null** value but it does have an enum that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent. It's called Option<T> and it's either Some(T) or None.
```rust
enum Option<T>{ // here <T> syntax is generics, which isn't covered yet, will be done in next lessons :)
    Some(T),
    None,
}

```

### Option enum is so useful that, its even included in the prelude, you don’t need to bring it into scope explicitly.
```rust
let some_number = Some(5);
let some_char = Some('e');

let absent_number: Option<i32> = None;
```
