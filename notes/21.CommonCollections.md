## Collections are data structures that can hold multiple values. Rust provides several built-in collection types, including vectors, strings, hash maps, and sets. These are stored in the Heap, and their references are stored in the Stack. This allows for efficient memory management and fast access to elements.

### There are mainly 3 types :
- #### A **vector** allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.
- #### A **string** is a collection of characters. We’ve mentioned the String type previously, but in this chapter we’ll talk about it in depth.
- #### A **hash map** allows you to associate a value with a specific key. It’s a particular implementation of the more general data structure called a map.


### There are other collections like, which are good to know but aren't coveered here - 
- **Sequences**: Vec, VecDeque, LinkedList
- **Maps**: HashMap, BTreeMap
- **Sets**: HashSet, BTreeSet
- **Misc**: BinaryHeap
