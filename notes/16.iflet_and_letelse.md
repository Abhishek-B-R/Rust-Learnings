# **if let** and **let else** keywords
### If you want only one possible value out of a bunch and want to drop off the rest of values, then there are 2 ways of doing it.
```rust
let config_max = Some(u8);

match config_max {
    Some(max) => println!("The maximum is configured to be {max}"),
    _ => (),
} // this is one way but its simply unnecessary and lengthy
// since match keyword is exhaustive, we have to handle all possible cases

if let Some(max) = config_max {
    println!("The maximum is configured to be {max}");
} // this is second and much better way and even looks cleaner
```


### The syntax **if let** takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal sign. It is much concise and readable. But only con is that it is not exhaustive.
### We can even use **else** keyword to handle the rest of values.
## We can convert below code as :
```rust
let mut count = 0;
match coin {
    Coin::Quarter(state) => println!("State quarter from {state:?}!"),
    _ => count += 1,
}


let mut count = 0;
if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin{
    println!("State quarter from {state:?}!")
} else {
    count += 1;
}
```

## To summarize, **if let** is used to handle specific cases in Rust. It provides a concise and readable way to match patterns and handle the rest of values.
# **let else**

## Here this below example can be written in 3 different ways wherein 2 are using **if let** and other is using **let else** keywords.
```rust
fn describ_state_quarter(coin : Coin) -> Option<String> {
    if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
        if state.existed_in(1900){
            Some(format!("{state:?} is pretty old, for America"))
        } else {
            Some(format!("{state:?} is relatively new"))
        }
    } else {
        None
    }
}
```
## This method is good but branched if else looks ugly, how about **None block early return?**
```rust
fn describ_state_quarter(coin : Coin) -> Option<String> {
    let state = if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
        state
    } else {
        return None;
    };

    if state.existed_in(1900){
        Some(format!("{state:?} is pretty old, for America"))
    } else {
        Some(format!("{state:?} is relatively new"))
    }
}
```

## This is also fine but we can make it even more consise and readable using **let else** block.
```rust
fn describ_state_quarter(coin : Coin) -> Option<String> {
    let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin else {
        return None;
    }; // best usecase is in API handling

    if state.existed_in(1900){
        Some(format!("{state:?} is pretty old, for America"))
    } else {
        Some(format!("{state:?} is relatively new"))
    }
}
```

## I know this syntax is weird and is reverse of variable declaration, but it's also more concise and readable.
