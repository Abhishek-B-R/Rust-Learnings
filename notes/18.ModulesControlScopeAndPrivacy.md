# Defining Modules to control scope and privacy

## In this section, we will learn modules, paths, **use**, **pub**, and **as** keywords.

### Starting from crate root, when compiling a crate, the compiler starts at the crate root file, which is usually named `main.rs` or `lib.rs`.
### **Declaring Modules** : to declare modules, we use **mod** keyword. If we declare `mod garden;`, the compiler will look for :
- Inline, within curly brackets that replace the semicolon following mod garden
- In the file src/garden.rs
- In the file src/garden/mod.rs

### **Declaring Submodules** : to declare submodules, we use **mod** keyword. If we declare `mod garden::vegetables; (in main.rs) or mod garder; (in garden.rs)`, the compiler will look for :
- Inline, within curly brackets that replace the semicolon following mod garden::vegetables
- In the file src/garden/vegetables.rs
- In the file src/garden/vegetables/mod.rs

### **Paths to code in modules** : Once a module is part of codebase, we can access it using paths. Paths can be absolute or relative. Absolute paths start with a crate name or `crate` for the current crate. Relative paths start with `self`, `super`, or an identifier in the current module.

#### Example :
```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {} // as mods are private by default
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

    //we can choose either of them depending on the situation
}
```

#### We can even use `super` to access parent module instead of `self` or defining the path from the root.
```rust
fn deliver_order() {}

mod back_of_house {
    fn fix_incorrect_order() {
        cook_order();
        super::deliver_order();
    }

    fn cook_order() {}
}
```

### **Private vs Public** : Code within a module is private by default. To make code public, we use **pub** keyword. If we declare `pub mod garden;`, the compiler will look for :
- Inline, within curly brackets that replace the semicolon following pub mod garden
- In the file src/garden.rs
- In the file src/garden/mod.rs

### **Use** : To bring a module into scope, we use **use** keyword. If we declare `use garden::vegetables::asparagus;`, then we can just use `asparagus` directly in our code anywhere we want.



# A great example of how things work actually
```rust
mod back_of_house {
    pub struct Breakfast {
        pub toast: String,
        seasonal_fruit: String,
    }

    impl Breakfast {
        pub fn summer(toast: &str) -> Breakfast {
            Breakfast {
                toast: String::from(toast),
                seasonal_fruit: String::from("peaches"),
            }
        }
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Order a breakfast in the summer with Rye toast.
    let mut meal = back_of_house::Breakfast::summer("Rye");
    // Change our mind about what bread we'd like.
    meal.toast = String::from("Wheat");
    println!("I'd like {} toast please", meal.toast);

    // The next line won't compile if we uncomment it; we're not allowed
    // to see or modify the seasonal fruit that comes with the meal.
    // meal.seasonal_fruit = String::from("blueberries");
}
```

# Here is another one 
```rust
mod back_of_house {
    pub enum Appetizer {
        Soup,
        Salad,
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    let order1 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Soup;
    let order2 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Salad;
}
```
