# Defining custom println for structs

## One way is to use **:?** syntax - called as Debug mode\
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle{
    height : u32,
    width : u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle{
        height : 10,
        width : 20,
    };
    println!("rectangle is {rect1:?}"); // rectangle is Rectangle { height: 10, width: 20 }
}
```


## Other way is to use **:#?** syntax - these are a bit more easier to read
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle{
    height : u32,
    width : u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle{
        height : 10,
        width : 20,
    };
    println!("rectangle is {rect1:#?}"); // prints this ->
    // rectangle is Rectangle {
    //     height: 10,
    //     width: 20,
    // }
}
```


# Another way to print out a value using the Debug format is to use the **dbg! macro**, which takes ownership of an expression (as opposed to println!, which takes a reference), prints the file and line number of where that dbg! macro call occurs in your code along with the resultant value of that expression, and returns ownership of the value.

```rust

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let scale = 2;
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: dbg!(30 * scale),
        height: 50,
    };

    dbg!(&rect1); // this prints ->
    // [src/main.rs:32:16] 30 * scale = 60
    // [src/main.rs:36:5] &rect1 = Rectangle {
    //     width: 60,
    //     height: 50,
    // }
}
```
