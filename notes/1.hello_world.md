# So after the installation of rustc and cargo, write the hello world funtion

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Here, fn main() is the entry point of the program. It is a function that takes no arguments and returns nothing. The function body is enclosed in curly braces {}. Inside the function body, we call the println! macro to print the string "Hello, world!" to the console. It is similar to int main() in C/C++.

println!("Hello, world!"); -> Here println is the fn name, "!" shows that its a **macro** function and () are to send args and arg sent is a string literal.

### **Macros** mean it is a special function that can be used to perform certain operations without having to write a lot of code. Macros are expanded at compile time, allowing for more flexibility and power in the language.
