# To update ur rust compiler, run
```bash
rustup update
```

# So after the installation of rustc and cargo, write the hello world funtion

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Here, fn main() is the entry point of the program. It is a function that takes no arguments and returns nothing. The function body is enclosed in curly braces {}. Inside the function body, we call the println! macro to print the string "Hello, world!" to the console. It is similar to int main() in C/C++.

println!("Hello, world!"); -> Here println is the fn name, "!" shows that its a **macro** function and () are to send args and arg sent is a string literal.

### **Macros** mean it is a special function that can be used to perform certain operations without having to write a lot of code. Macros are expanded at compile time, allowing for more flexibility and power in the language.

# Now initialize a new rust project but this time using cargo
Run this
```bash
cargo new 2.cargo --name cargo
```
This will create a new directory named 2.cargo with a Cargo.toml file and a src directory containing a main.rs file.

The main.rs is same as we did earlier, but Cargo.toml is a configuration file for the project. It contains metadata about the project, such as its name, version, and dependencies. The dependencies in rust are called as crates. They are used to add functionality to your project. They can be added by adding them to the [dependencies] section of the Cargo.toml file.
