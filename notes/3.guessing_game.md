# Guessing Game

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number");
    println!("Enter a number");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read nuber");

    println!("Guessed number is {guess}");

}
```

### So this is the entire codebase, let's break it down neatly.

## use std::io; -> is a standard rust library for input/output operations.
## use rand::Rng; -> is a standard rust library for random number generation.

# **In rust variables are immutable by default, but can be made mutable using the mut keyword.**
## That's why we use **mut** keyword while declaring above variable. **let** is used to declare a variable.

## String::new() is used to create a new empty string. **String::new()** creates a new empty string. And **=** is used to assign a value to a variable.

# Recieving a user input :
## We need std::io::stdin() to recieve user input. (we can import std::io and then called io::stdin()      or       we can import std::io::stdin() and then just call it as stdin()      or     we can just call it as std::io::stdin() whereever we want to use it)
## Then we have read_line() fn which is from stdin() object. Which takes the address of the variable wherein we want to store the input.

## And the arg we are sending is **&mut guess**. **&mut** is used to pass a mutable reference(addresses are also immutable by default) to a variable. **&** is used to pass a reference to a variable.
## And **.expect("Failed to read number");** is error handler which handles the error if the user input is not a number.
