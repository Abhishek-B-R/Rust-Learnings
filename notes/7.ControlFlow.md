# Control Flow

## If-else statements
### if else statements in rust should not have a circular parentheses for conditions but should have flower brackets for blocks. Ex:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    if x == 5 {
        println!("x is five!");
    } else if x == 6 {
        println!("x is six!");
    } else {
        println!("x is not five!");
    }
}
```

#### Here, x == 5 condition shouldn't have any circular parentheses. While the work to be done if condition is true or false should be enclosed in flower brackets.
#### Similar to Java, rust also expects the if condition to be a boolean, if you send it an integer or string, it will throw a compile time error.


## Using if in a let sentence
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = if x == 5 { 10 } else { 20 }; // y = 10;
}
```
### Here, value of y is decided based on the value of x.


## Loops in Rust
### Rust has 3 kinds of loops: `loop`, `while`, and `for`.
#### `loop` is a keyword that creates an infinite loop. It can be used to create a loop that runs forever until a break statement is encountered.
#### `while` is a keyword that creates a loop that runs as long as a condition is true. It can be used to create a loop that runs a certain number of times or until a certain condition is met.
#### `for` is a keyword that creates a loop that iterates over a collection of items. It can be used to create a loop that iterates over a range of numbers or over a collection of items.


### **loop**
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 0;
    loop {
        println!("looping forever!");
        x += 1;
        if x == 10 {
            break;
        }
    }
} // prints "looping forever!" 10 times
```

### Loop labels to disambiguate between multiple loops
#### If you use **break**, **continue**, or **return** statements, you can label the loop with a name and use that name to break, continue, or return from the loop.
#### For example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 0;
    'outer: loop {
        println!("outer loop");
        loop {
            println!("inner loop");
            x += 1;
            if x == 5 {
                break 'outer;
            }
        }
    }
} // prints "outer loop" and "inner loop" 5 times
```

### **While** loop
```rust
fn main() {
    let arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index < arr.len() {
        println!("Element at index {}: {}", index, arr[index]);
        index += 1;
    }
}
```
#### It is similar to other languages, no difference at all

### **For** loop
```rust
fn main() {
    let arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
    for element in arr {
        println!("Element is {}", element);
    }
}
```
