# Separating Modules in Different Files

#### When modules get large, you might want to move their definitions to a separate file to make the code easier to navigate.

## There are 2 types of doing this:
- src/front_of_house.rs (which is done in the codes/15.SeparatingModules)
- src/front_of_house/mod.rs (older style, still supported path)

### Similarly, for a submodule named hosting, 
- src/front_of_house/hosting.rs (what we covered)
- src/front_of_house/hosting/mod.rs (older style, still supported path)


#### If you use both styles for the same module, you’ll get a compiler error. Using a mix of both styles for different modules in the same project is allowed, but might be confusing for people navigating your project.
