# Cargo cmds

## To convert an existing rust project to use cargo, run
```bash
cargo init
```

## To initialize a new cargo project, run
```bash
cargo new <project_name>
```

## To initialize a new cargo project with a specific name (useful if u wanna create a folder that starts with a number, etc.), run
```bash
cargo new <project_name> --name <project_name>
```

## To build a cargo project, run
```bash
cargo build
```

## To run a cargo project, run
```bash
cargo run
```

## In order to just check if code is correct without creating a binary (It is useful because it is faster than building), run
```bash
cargo check
```


## Building a project for release(for deployment), this cmd will compile project with many optimizations and will create a binary that is optimized for release
```bash
cargo build --release
```
